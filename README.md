# ME Common Libraries (TCL)

This is a small set of libraries that I use in TCL projects.
Most libraries in this package work in Jim in addition to Tcl.
Some are much more primitive versions of things that exist in Tcllib
(such as the ANSI formatting routines and logging), but are provided
here for ease of use and Jim support.

This library is intended to be included as a submodule or a subtree
in a project, or to have individual files copied, not installed.

**Note:** Version numbers in package specifications are not currently
meaningful.
