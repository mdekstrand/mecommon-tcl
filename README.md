# ME Common Libraries (TCL)

This is a small set of libraries that I use in TCL projects.
Most libraries in this package work in Jim in addition to Tcl.
Some are much more primitive versions of things that exist in Tcllib
(such as the ANSI formatting routines and logging), but are provided
here for ease of use and Jim support.
